# HideStatusBarItems

A simple tweak which helps to hide specific components in the statusbar like the battery text, battery icon, carrier text, wifi icon and many more..

Enable this tweak from settings -> Select components to hide -> Hit the Apply Changes button -> That's it.

Enjoy!

This is my first tweak so feel free to report any bugs.
